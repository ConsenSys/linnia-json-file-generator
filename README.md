# Linnia JSON File Generator

Welcome to the fake file generator! The Linia Team threw this together so you
could spend less time making fake data and more time building! In order to get
this working for you, you should change three things:

1. Change `numberOfFiles` to equal the amount of files you want to generate
2. Change the `fileSchema` to make that of the data you want to produce.
3. Change the `fileName` function to product the name for the file that you want.

To get started, head over to `index.js` and follow the steps provided in the comments.
